Project Scope of Work
Build a transformer-based image2story generation model. We initially generate a caption for an input image and then generate a story for it, which is basically doing story generation given an image. 
I will build it as an end-to-end task.
Relevant applications and libraries: Pytorch/Tensorflow, BARD, GPT
